# Renaming Files for Clarity and Learning

The files in this repository have been renamed to be more descriptive and to follow a logical progression. This makes it easier to understand the purpose of each file and how they build on each other.

## Part 1: Getting Started with OpenAI

This part introduces the fundamental concepts of interacting with the OpenAI API.

*   **`prompt_1a.py` -> `1_basic_prompt.py`**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is the most basic example, sending a single prompt to the API. The new name reflects this simplicity.

*   **`prompt_1b.py` -> `2_system_prompt_role_playing.py`**
    *   **Reasoning:** This file introduces the "system" role to make the AI adopt a persona. The new name clearly states this concept.

*   **`prompt_1c.py` -> `3_json_output.py`**
    *   **Reasoning:** This script shows how to force the model to return JSON formatted output. The new name is direct and descriptive.

*   **`prompt_1d.py` -> `4_few_shot_learning.py`**
    *   **Reasoning:** This file demonstrates "few-shot learning" by providing examples in the prompt. The new name uses the technical term for this technique.

*   **`challenge_1.py` -> `5_challenge_restaurant_recommender.py`**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a challenge that combines the concepts from the previous files. The new name describes the specific challenge.

## Part 2: Building AI Agents

This part focuses on building agents that can use tools.

*   **`calculator_agent.py` -> `1_simple_agent_calculator.py`**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a simple agent that uses a single tool (a calculator). The new name reflects this.

*   **`math_tutor.py` -> `2_multi_function_agent_math_tutor.py`**
    *   **Reasoning:** This agent can use multiple functions (add, subtract, etc.). The new name highlights this capability.

## Part 3: Advanced Agent Examples

This part contains more complex agent examples.

*   **`app.py` -> `1_simple_api_call.py`**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a very basic script that just calls the API. The new name clarifies its purpose.

*   **`multitool.py` -> `2_multi_tool_agent_study_buddy.py`**
    *   **Reasoning:** This agent uses multiple tools (a calculator and a lookup tool). The new name is more descriptive of its function.

*   **`m2.py` -> `3_study_buddy_pro.py`**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a more advanced version of the study buddy agent. The "Pro" in the new name suggests this.

*   **`notes.txt` -> `study_buddy_notes.txt`**
    *   **Reasoning:** This file contains the notes for the study buddy agent. The new name makes this connection clear.
